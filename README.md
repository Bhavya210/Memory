# Simple Memory Design and Simulation using VHDL in Xilinx

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains VHDL code and simulation files to help you create and test memory modules using Xilinx tools. Memory is like a digital storage space, and this project offers an easy way to design and simulate different types of memory using VHDL.

## What's Inside?

### 1. `ram.vhdl`

This file is like a blueprint for a type of memory called Random Access Memory (RAM). RAM is a temporary storage that allows quick reading and writing of data. It's like a fast, accessible shelf where you can put and take things as needed.

### 2. `rom.vhdl`

Here, we have another file for Read-Only Memory (ROM). Unlike RAM, ROM is like a permanent bookshelf. You can read data from it, but you can't change what's stored there. It's perfect for information that doesn't change often.

### 3. `sim_ram.tcl` and `sim_rom.tcl`

These are scripts that help set up simulations in Xilinx Vivado. Think of them as instructions for testing our memory modules in a virtual environment before using them in a real project.

## How to Use

1. **Get the Code:** Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2. **Open Vivado:** If you don't have it, you can download Xilinx Vivado for free.
3. **Create a New Project:** Use Vivado to set up a new project and add our memory files.
4. **Run Simulations:** Use the provided scripts to run simulations and see how our memory modules behave.

## Customize for Your Needs

Feel free to change the VHDL code to fit your specific requirements. If you need more or less memory, or if you want to store different types of data, you can modify the code accordingly.

## What to Look For

After running simulations, check the results to make sure our memory modules are working as expected. Ensure that reading and writing data happen correctly.

## Conclusion

This project is like a starter kit for understanding and using memory in digital systems. Memory is a crucial part of computers and electronics, and this resource helps you get hands-on experience with creating and testing different types of memory.
